<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview
   Despite this challenge looked a little easy i had many problems when i started solving it. The problems were related to the height of
   some elements. i couldn't set a responsive and flex height, so i had to use several media queries and that is not ideal at all. My knowledge is
   still basic so for that reason i didn't find a way to solve that issue. On the other hand, by solving this challenge i strengthened my grid and flexbox skills.

### Built With
